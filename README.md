# Chords Book

This React application was created in order to refresh my React knowledge.

[Demo](https://chords.dimasi.online)

With this application you can create the sets of chords for songs you like. Additionally, it is possible to switch 
between two instruments: Guitar and Ukulele. Such functions as searching and sort out of the songs are also 
available in the app.

The application uses LocalStorage browser for storing the data.

It is created by React, TypeScript, MobX + Mobx Persist Store and Styled Components.
